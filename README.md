# digital_spirit_level
A digital spirit level for the Nexys A7 FPGA.

## Desription
This is a digital spriti level which communicates with an accelerometer via SPI to gather gravitational acceleration data in three dimensions.
Based on the gravitaional acceleration it calculates the angle of the and outputs the result to an LCD and the 7-segment display.
Data is also sent over the UART-USB Bridge to send data to a PC.
